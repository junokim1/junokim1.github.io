  title: About Me
  summary: |
    I am an incoming Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley.
    My interests lie in the <b>mathematical foundations of deep learning</b>,
    with a focus on nonconvex optimization, dynamical analysis, and statistical guarantees for neural networks.
    I am also interested in understanding emergent capabilities of foundation models such as chain-of-thought reasoning.
    
    Previously, I received my B.Sc. in Mathematics and Statistics at Seoul National University as Valedictorian of '23,
    and my M.Sc. in Mathematical Informatics at the University of Tokyo advised by Prof. Taiji Suzuki,
    where I received the Dean's Award for outstanding research.
