  title: About Me
  summary: |
    I am a Master's student at the University of Tokyo, supervised by Prof. Taiji Suzuki,
    also associated with RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project.
    My research interests lie in the mathematical foundations of modern deep learning,
    focusing on nonconvex optimization, dynamical analysis and statistical guarantees for neural networks,
    as well as exploring emergent capabilities of foundation models.
    Before moving to Japan, I received my B.Sc. in Mathematics and Statistics at Seoul National University
    as Valedictorian of '23. # You can contact me at: junokim (at) g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp
